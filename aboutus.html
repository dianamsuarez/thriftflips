    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>ThriftFlips is a retail store located in Los Angeles, CA. We are a relatively smaller company as we just opened about a year ago since the owner, Diana Suarez, developed the idea over the course of the pandemic. The concept behind ThriftFlips is that Diana purchases products from thrift stores and finds new, creative ways to bring the piece back to life through processes like re-sewing, reupholstering, painting, etc. These pieces include mostly clothing items, but also feature products such as jewelry, shoes, and small household decor pieces. She started ThriftFlips because she wanted to bring sustainability back into retail while offering unique, upcycled items to a community with such a heavy emphasis on fashion. With that being said, Diana strives to create a brand image of being sustainable, fashion-forward, and one-of-a-kind.
        ThriftFlips’ target audience are young, fashion-forward individuals who hold high value in purchasing from sustainable companies. The demographic of this type of audience are primarily females ranging between the ages of 18-26 located in Southern California. Los Angeles is an area with lots of personality and in order to stand out, these individuals need affordable, unique pieces of clothing, accessories, and decor without having to sacrifice their care for the environment.
